# Interactive 3D Space Solar System
This is a showcase of my project SolarSYS: It is a simple and lightweight browser-based 3D simulation of the solar system, built with WebGL and powered by Three.js. Over the course, it took me five days. This designed as a simple demo and exploratory tool.

Note: You may encounter misplaced texts, rendering issues. It's still currently on development, please except those bugs. It's my first project.
Features:
- Zoom In and Out using your mouse's scroll
- Draggable Cameras
- Lighting
- Audio
