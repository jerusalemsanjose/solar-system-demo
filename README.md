# This version is absolute shit. Too many issues
This is a showcase of my project SolarSYS: It is a simple and lightweight browser-based 3D simulation of the solar system, built with WebGL and powered by Three.js.
Also, You may see misplaced texts, and rendering issues. This is because due to your display screen.

This project makes use of the following external resources:
