# solar-system-demo
This is a showcase of my project SolarSYS: It is a simple and lightweight browser-based 3D simulation of the solar system, built with WebGL and powered by Three.js. Over the course, it took me two days. This designed as a simple demo and exploratory tool. Although, I'm not done it with it yet. Developed By: Taan, Jerusalem S.

Features:
- Zoom In and Out using your mouse's scroll
- Draggable Cameras
- Lighting
- Audio

This project makes use of the following external resources:

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) — WebGL framework for 3D rendering
- [Planet Pixel Emporium](https://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html) — Solar System's Planets Textures
